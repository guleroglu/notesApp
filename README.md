# Notes App üìù

In this project, we've developed a simple notebook app that allows you to organize your notes by adding colors. Using the app is quite easy:

## Features ‚ú®

- Color Selection: When creating a note, you can choose one of five different color options. These color choices are used to determine the background color of your note.

- Note Creation: After making your color selection, you can write your desired note and save it by clicking the "Add" button.

- Colorful Notes: Each note you create becomes distinctive with the background color corresponding to your chosen color. This way, you can categorize your notes with colors and review them more easily.

- Search and Delete: You can search for your notes using the search bar at the top. Additionally, you can delete notes by double-clicking on them.

- This notebook app allows you to organize your notes by adding colors and filter them according to your needs. Enjoy using it!
